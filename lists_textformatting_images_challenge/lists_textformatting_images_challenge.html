<!-- My paragraphs -->
        <p>Preheat the oven and a roasting tray to 220ºC/425ºF/gas 7.</p>
        <p>Pick and finely chop the <em><strong>soft herbs, halve the lemon and tear the bay leaves</strong></em>.</p>
        <p>Rub inside the chicken cavity with <em><strong>sea salt</strong></em>, then carefully grab the skin at the tip of the <em><strong>chicken breasts</strong></em>, making sure that it doesn't rip, and pull up gently. With your other hand gently separate the skin from the meat of the breast – it's normally connected by a little bit of tissuey-type stuff, and you can either leave this attached in the middle and make two little tunnels either side or you can try to cut away the middle.
        </p>
        <p>Sprinkle a little <em><strong>salt</strong></em> down the gaps that you have made, push in most of the chopped herbs and drizzle in a little <em><strong>oil</strong></em>.</p>
        <p>Push the <em><strong>lemon halves</strong></em> into the cavity along with the bay and <em><strong>rosemary sprigs</strong></em>, then pull the skin of the chicken breast forward so that none of the flesh is exposed, tuck the little winglets under, and tie up as firmly as possible.</p>
        <p>Rub a little <em><strong>oil</strong></em> all over the chicken skin, scatter over the remaining chopped <em><strong>herbs</strong></em> and season very generously with <em><strong>salt and black pepper</strong></em>. Slash each thigh about 3 or 4 times to allow the heat to penetrate directly.</p>
        <p>Remove the hot tray from the oven and <em><strong>drizzle with a little oil</strong></em>. Put the <em><strong>chicken</strong></em> into the tray, breast-side down and leaning to one side, then place in the oven. Roast for 5 minutes, then lean it to the other side, still breast-side down. Cook for another 5 minutes, then place the <em><strong>chicken</strong></em> on its bottom and cook for 1 further hour, or until golden and cooked through – the skin should be really crispy and the herbs will flavour the meat– this really must be the best roast chicken. Trust me – it's not fiddly, it's pukka.</p>

    <h4>Summary :Roast Chicken</h4>
        <p> 
            Roast chicken is chicken prepared as food by roasting whether in a home kitchen, over a fire, or with a professional rotisserie (rotary spit). Generally, the chicken is roasted with its own fat and juices by circulating the meat during roasting, and therefore, are usually cooked exposed to fire or heat with some type of rotary grill so that the circulation of these fats and juices is as efficient as possible.
